  <h1>Reflection Questions:</h1> 
  <br>
  <h2>1. What advantages do cloud services like Netlify provide?</h2>
  <p>Netlify makes deployment easy, automatic and free. It provides a live website URL, handles updates from GitHub automatically and removes the need to manage servers.</p> 
  <br>
  <h2>2. How is this different from hosting a website on your local computer?</h2>
  <p>Hosting on a local computer means only you or people on your network can access it. With cloud hosting, your website is available online 24/7 for anyone in the world.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>3. What are other types of cloud services youâ€™ve heard of?</h2>
  <p>Other examples are Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure, which provide cloud storage, computing power, and databases.</p>
